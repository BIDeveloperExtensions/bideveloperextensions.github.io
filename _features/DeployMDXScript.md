This feature allows you to right click on a cube in an Analysis Services solution and deploy just the calculation script.

You can also deploy the MDX script by clicking the button in the toolbar above the calc script:

Note: This feature is not available when editing a cube in online mode as there is no need to deploy when you are working in online mode.

_Note: To capture the XMLA *{{site.title}}* uses to deploy the MDX Script (so that you could deploy to a different environment without {{site.ms-designer}}) see this [blog post](http://blog.davyknuysen.be/2010/05/05/xmla-script-to-deploy-mdx-calculations/)._
