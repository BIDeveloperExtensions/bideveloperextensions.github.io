**Visual Studio 2015**

*{{site.title}}* for SQL 2016 is installed in Visual Studio 2015 and this version of the add-in is published in the Visual Studio Gallery. To install it, go to Tools... Extensions and Updates... go to the Online tab and then search for *BIDS Helper* (be patient as we are in the progress of renaming to *{{site.title}}*):

You can also download it from the Visual Studio Gallery in a web browser [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsgallery/e8c17a53-f117-426d-9e92-407115777d6e).

**KNOWN ISSUE:** When installing SSDT, install SSAS, SSRS, and SSIS. *{{site.title}}* does not currently support partial installs of SSDT.


**Visual Studio 2017**

If you must use Visual Studio 2017 then click [furmangg](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/furmangg) and shoot me an email to become a beta tester as we work on support.
