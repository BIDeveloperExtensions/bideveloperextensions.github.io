title: A new host and a new name
---

With the closing down of [Codeplex](www.codeplex.com) later this year the BIDS Helper project is moving to a new home on [GitHub](http://bideveloperextensions.github.io) and along with that move a decision was made by the project team to rename the project to "BI Developer Extensions". 

BIDS was the old name for what is now known as SSDT and has slowly been becoming less and less relevant with many new BI developers not knowing what BIDS was. So the decision was taken to move to a more generic and descriptive name.
