The Printer Friendly Aggregations feature allows you print or export to PDF a report that lists every aggregation in a cube. This report can be used for documentation or for team review. It can be launched from the main Aggregation Manager window:

Exporting to a PDF reproduces the first half of the report well for printing purposes.

However, an Excel export often works better for the second half of the report since the pages can be very wide depending on the number of dimensions in each measure group.
