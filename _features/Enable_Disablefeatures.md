It is possible to enable and disable individual features. Certain features are triggered by events like the creation and activation of windows (eg. Calculation Helpers, Expression Highlighter, dtsConfig Formatter). If you ever feel that any of these features are causing you issues, they can be individually turned off rather than having to disable *{{site.title}}* entirely. Also, if there are any features that you find you never use, then you can switch those off too if you would prefer not to see those options in the menus.

This settings window can be seen under Tools... Options... *{{site.title}}*:
