All issues and feature requests can be found on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/BIDeveloperExtensions/bideveloperextensions/issues) list. Please check the existing issue before creating a new one to avoid creating duplicates.

> If you had an issue that was previously logged on the [old codeplex site](http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic) that you would like to keep alive please raise a new issue on GitHub. You might also search the old issues list to see if that question has previously been asked and answered.
